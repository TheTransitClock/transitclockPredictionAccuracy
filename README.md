The intention of this project is to store data and graphs for test runs of different versions of transiTime to ensure that as changes are introduced that the prediction qaulity is maintained or indeed improved.

A sub directory will be created for each fork or branch that is merged.

Currently the tests being run are using this version of [transitime docker](https://github.com/scrudden/transitime-docker/tree/prediction_comparison_hart).
